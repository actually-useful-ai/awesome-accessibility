Accessibility is about inclusive design and ensuring technology can be used by anyone, regardless of ability or disability. This repo collects high-quality open source resources, tools, and knowledge to help make technology accessible and empower users.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility is essential for upholding diversity and human rights in our digital world. By designing solutions usable by all, we can build a society that values each person's unique contributions.

**"For some people technology makes things easier, for others it makes things possible."**

## Our Mission

This repo serves as a gateway for developers, designers, educators, and all accessibility advocates to find and share techniques for empowering users through inclusive technology.
